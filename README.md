Welcome to the website of the Grace College Math Program.  We'll use this place to post updates on projects we're working on, general news, and Jesse Humberd Problems.

We're currently working on a project to apply basic sabermetrics to the Crossroads Baseball league.

You can find that project here: [Crossroads Baseball](../portfolio/portfolio-1/)
